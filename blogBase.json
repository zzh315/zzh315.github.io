However, if this had been a real phishing attack, the consequences could have been catastrophic:\r\n\r\n- **Personal and company information leaks**\r\n- **Financial losses**\r\n- **Compromised security of SisterWorks\u2019 systems**\r\n\r\nTaking phishing seriously is crucial to protect yourself, your colleagues, and the mission of SisterWorks. Read on to learn how to identify and avoid these attacks in the future.\r\n\r\n## **What is Phishing?**\r\n\r\nPhishing is a cyberattack where scammers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive information, such as:\r\n\r\n- Login credentials  \r\n- Personal information  \r\n- Financial details  \r\n\r\nThese attacks often come in the form of emails, text messages, or phone calls. Hackers use clever tricks to make their messages appear legitimate, but there are ways to spot them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **How to Identify Phishing Attempts**\r\n\r\nHere are some common red flags:\r\n\r\n\r\nPhishing emails are often designed to trick you into thinking they are legitimate. Use these tips to identify and avoid them:\r\n\r\n### **1. Verify Email Domains**\r\n- Legitimate SisterWorks emails will always come from **@sisterworks.org.au**.\r\n- In this phishing simulation, the email you received came from **sisterworks.970315.xyz**\u2014notice the suspicious and misspelled domain name. Always check for inconsistencies in email addresses.\r\n- Common phishing pattern: Misspelled domain names that look similar to real ones (e.g., **@sisterw0rks.org.au** or **@sisterworks-login.org**).\r\n- **Example**: A phishing email pretending to be from LinkedIn may use a domain like **linkedn.com** or **1inkedin.com** instead of **linkedin.com**. Always look closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **2. Verify Links Before Clicking**\r\n- **Hover over the link** (without clicking) to see the destination URL. A legitimate link will match the organization's official domain.\r\n- **Example**: A legitimate Infoodle link would look like:\r\n  - Displayed:              **infoodle.com**\r\n  - Actual URL (hover): **infoodle.com**  \r\n![legitInfoodlefinal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99713c7e-d0d5-4324-9c93-d3661e173448)\r\n\r\n- Phishing links, however, might appear similar but redirect you elsewhere:\r\n  - Displayed: **infoodle.com**\r\n  - Actual URL: **infood1e.org**  \r\n  \r\n![phishInfoodle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/037f0f40-f121-4a67-a172-caa0bfdcf5c9)\r\n\r\n- **Tip**: Always try access websites by typing the URL directly into your browser or using saved bookmarks when possible, rather than clicking email links if you're unsure.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **3. Look for Misspellings and Poor Grammar**\r\n- Phishing emails often have spelling errors or awkward language.  \r\n- Example: 'Dear coustomer, your acount has been susspended. Please login to resolve the issue.'  \r\n- Legitimate companies typically proofread their communications carefully.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **4. Be Wary of Urgent or Unusual Requests**\r\n- Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.  \r\n- Phrases like 'Your account will be locked in 24 hours' or 'You must confirm your payment immediately' are designed to make you panic.  \r\n- If unsure, consult your supervisor or IT department before responding or taking any action.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **5. Check Attachments Carefully**\r\n- Avoid opening unexpected attachments, especially if they have suspicious file extensions like **.exe**, **.zip**, or **.scr**.  \r\n- Most legitimate external emails typically do not include unexpected attachments. When in doubt, verify with the sender or your IT team.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## **What to Do if You Suspect Phishing**\r\n\r\nIf you think an email might be a phishing attempt, follow these steps immediately:\r\n\r\n### **1. Stop and Think**\r\n- Don\u2019t click any links, open attachments, or reply to the message.  \r\n- Take a moment to evaluate the email for signs of phishing (e.g., suspicious sender, misspellings, urgent requests).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **2. Verify the Email**\r\n- **Check the sender's address**: Does it match the official domain?  \r\n- **Hover over links**: Do the URLs match the company's official website?  \r\n- If you're unsure, contact the sender through an official channel. Do not use any contact information provided in the suspicious email.\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **3. Report the Email**\r\n- **Forward the email** to **[sabrina@sisterworks.org.au](mailto:sabrina@sisterworks.org.au)** so the IT Team can investigate.  \r\n- Mark the email as spam in your inbox to prevent further communication from that address.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28090614-8bbe-4aeb-b29d-bcdeb29baea7)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **4. Update Your Passwords**\r\n- If you suspect you clicked a malicious link or entered your information, change your passwords immediately.  \r\n- Use a strong, unique password and always enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **5. Inform the IT Team**\r\n- If you think you\u2019ve been phished, inform the IT Team (sabrina@sisterworks.org.au) immediately. The faster we act, the more we can minimize potential damage.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy following these steps, you help protect both yourself and SisterWorks from potential phishing attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Quiz: Test Your Phishing Detection Skills**\r\n\r\nTry these questions to see how well you can spot phishing emails.
